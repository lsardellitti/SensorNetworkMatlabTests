# Sensor Network Matlab Tests

This repository contains a series of MATLAB scripts that were used to run numerical and simulated experiments for distributed detection over sensor networks. The code is separated into two folders, each of which contains their own documentation within for how they can be used.

## Two User
Contains code pertaining to sensor networks with only two sensors.

## Multi User
Contains code pertaining to sensor networks with an arbitrary number of sensors.
